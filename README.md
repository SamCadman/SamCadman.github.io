### How It Acted

The argentavis because of its immense weight and size would get around mostly 
by soaring and gliding, only flapping ever so often to stay in the air. 
Also it was thought because of its weight, its bones were filled with air. There isn’t much else know about how the argentavis acted due to it being extinct for over 
6,000,000 years.

## How did the Argentavis live and how long did it live?

### The Argentavis Lifespan

The Argentavis is thought to have had a lifespan of 50 - 100 years. The only information backing 
this up is the fact that animals of the argentavis size live to that age.

### The Argentavis Lifestyle

There’s not much known about the day to day life of the Argentavis but this is the extent that is known.
The argentavis would most likely fly around in search for rodents, animal babies, and other small animals. They were also known to live in South America.
They required roughly 10 pounds of meat every day so that would most likely spend a lot of time trying to suffice that need.
They have a need, a need for meat! (It was bad quit your hate)

## All about the Argentavis’ habitat.

The argentavis resided in the Skies of South America. To be more exact they were thought to have lived in Argentina.
When the argentavis wasn’t flying through the skies it would be scavenging the rain forest and mountainous terrain.
The argentavis adapted to the Argentinian environment as shown by the argentavis pelvic bone structure, the argentavis would have been quite agile.
This is quite useful for travel in Argentina because they could climb up mountains with ease and weave through the dense argentinian forests.
They were also built so they could travel long distances on land, unlike most birds which were and still are built more for air travel.
