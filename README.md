### How It Acted

The argentavis because of its immense weight and size would get around mostly 
by soaring and gliding, only flapping ever so often to stay in the air. 
Also it was thought because of its weight, its bones were filled with air. There isnâ€™t much else know about how the argentavis acted due to it being extinct for over 
6,000,000 years.
